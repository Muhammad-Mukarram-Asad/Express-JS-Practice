When to Use Each Method
app.use(express.static(...)): Use this when you have a directory of static files (e.g., HTML, CSS, JS) that you want to serve directly and automatically without defining routes for each file.

app.use(express.json()): Use this when you expect JSON data in your request bodies and need to parse it for further processing in your routes.

response.sendFile(): Use this when you need to serve a specific file in response to a particular route or request. Choose between the relative path method or the path join method based on your preference for path construction.

const express = require('express');
const path = require('path');
const app = express();

// Serve static files from the "views" directory
app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, "views")));

// Parse JSON request bodies
app.use(express.json());

// Serve a specific file using relative path method
app.get('/file1', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile("./views/index.html", { root: __dirname });
});

// Serve a specific file using path join method
app.get('/file2', (req, res) => {
  res.sendFile(path.join(__dirname, "views", "index.html"));
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on port 3000");
});
